            <h2>London</h2>
            <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a
                metropolitan area
                of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going
                back to its
                founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.</p>
